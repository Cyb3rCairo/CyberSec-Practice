# CyberSec-Practice
This project is a hands-on exploration of Metasploitable 2, a purposely vulnerable virtual machine designed for cybersecurity practice. I used tools like Nmap and Metasploit to identify, exploit, and learn how to secure common vulnerabilities. Itâ€™s all documented step by step with images to help beginners (like me!) follow along and learn.
